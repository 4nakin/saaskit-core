                                                <p>After signing up and completing your payment details, you won't be charged anything for 21 days. After 21 days your paid
 plan will start and your first payment will be made. If you cancel your Project account before the 21 day free trial ends, you will not be charged any amount.</p>
                                                <p class="questions">Is this a long-term commitment?</p>

                                                <p>Nope! You pay a monthly fee and are able to cancel at any time or upgrade / downgrade to a plan that suits you better.</

                                                <p class="questions">What forms of payment do you accept?</p>

                                                <p>Payments are via credit card and are processed by PayPal. PayPal accepts most major credit cards such as Visa, Mastercar
d, American Express & Discover. We do not offer other forms of payment at this time.</p>
                                                <p class="questions">Is Project SEO Friendly?</p>

                                                <p>Project links use a 301 Redirect which passes all "link juice" on to the target URL and is SEO friendly.</p>
                                                <p class="questions">What happens to my campaign links if I cancel my account?</p>

                                                <p>Your campaign links will continue to redirect people to the target url. You just won't be able to log in and view conver
sions and click reports :(</p>

se Project.</p>
